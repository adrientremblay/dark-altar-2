So this is Verlorenstadt. They send a lone priest to do the affair of troupe of armsmen. How strange...


A whole town gone missing? God is my witness, it must be bandits...

And that fellow down the road? Who ceased not to bumble about this society. Society of the Dark Altar he said.

Cedric Leopold was their leader. The church is not ignorant of this heretic. He was the first to go missing.
