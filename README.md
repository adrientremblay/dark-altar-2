# Core Design Philosophy
- Player feels anxiety due to time restraints
    - They need to find skull at each location within a set amount of time
        - Otherwise it gets too haunted
    - They need to keep their candle lit by finding more candles otherwise game over
- Player feels in danger because of Cedric Leopold
    - Player should feel like Cedric is intelligent
    - Player should feel like Cedric is stalking them
        - Cedric should be barely visible
        - He should follow the player from behind and dissapear (TP?) if the player spots him
    - Player should feel like Cedric is dangerous
        - He should act aggressive (AT TIMES)
            - Agression increases when the player spends too long in a location & decreases when they spend time in the woods
        - Agression means he starts getting closer to the player
            - Eventually he will full on start walking after the player
            - And then eventually he will start sprinting towards them
