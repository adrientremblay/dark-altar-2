# Core Design Philosophy
- Player feels anxiety due to time restraints
    - They need to find skull at each location within a set amount of time
        - Otherwise it gets too haunted
    - They need to keep their candle lit by finding more candles otherwise game over

# High level Gameplay Loop
- Player 

# Script

    - Player reads first note
    - Walks to a location
    - Searches for a skull
    - Finds 1st skull
