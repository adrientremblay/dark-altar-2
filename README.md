# Core Design Philosophy
- Player feels anxiety due to time restraints
    - They need to find skull at each location within a set amount of time
        - Otherwise it gets too haunted
    - They need to keep their candle lit by finding more candles otherwise game over
- Player feels in danger because of Cedric Leopold
    - Player should feel like Cedric is intelligent
    - Player should feel like Cedric is stalking them
        - Cedric should be barely visible
        - He should follow the player from behind and dissapear (TP?) if the player spots him
    - Player should feel like Cedric is dangerous
        - He should act aggressive (AT TIMES)
            - Agression increases when the player spends too long in a location & decreases when they spend time in the woods
        - Agression means he starts getting closer to the player
            - Eventually he will full on start walking after the player
            - And then eventually he will start sprinting towards them

### Cedric Leopold's Diary (1/4)

Febuary 17, 1771

I have been explused from the Seminaire de Saint Suplice in Montreal. And my crime? Asking heretical questions they say. I simply desire to know why God has seemingly revealed his true message to us alone. Meanwhile, so many believe in God but have warped his message. Even more perculiar are the savages here in the new world who do not even believe in god. They believe in animals, spirits, and soforth. Why would god allow all these people to be misguided? To be damned to hell? Why is it our burden as Jesuit missionaries to lead them back to the light? Why is this not the burden of God?

My punishment is that we are to travel far east into the uncivilized parts of Acadia. We are to make contact with and convert remote Mik'Maq communities. The voyage will be perillous. We are to travel by boat from Chambly to Louisbourg, Ile Royale. After resting, we are to take another boat to the Lunenburg. From there, we shall travel deep inland towards the north.


### Cedric Leopold's Diary (2/4)

March 18, 1773

Today, I met Father Hugues who is to be my mentor for the expedition. With him is Niskwa, an Algonquin who will serve as interpreter, though I speak the fundamentals. Also, there is Gauthier the voyageur who will help us with navigation and labour. We also have two merceneries named Armand and Gaspard.

Hugues has apparently already made the voyage and has already met with several groups of Mik'Maq. He showed me a map with multiple villages marked on it. I am anxious to begin our work. I seek to redeem myself before the Lord and before the church. Part of me also secretly yearns to learn of the strange religion of these savage peoples.

### History of the ... people

### The Ohuyuga people - Cedric Leopold

On my 

It was an anthropology book. Or more accurately a book on religions of antiquity in ancient Mesopotamia, India, Pacific Islands continents, and North America. The book presented the theory that contrary to most religions still in practice today which personify their god as humanoid, that the spiritual or religious beliefs of a people group start by deifying worldly animals or natural phenomena. The theory states that cultures then phase out the animalistic qualities of their religions icons, slowly giving them human properties (a prime example of this being the animal-human hybrid gods of Ancient Egyptian religion and Hinduism). The central thesis of the book is that newborn religions created in isolation without the influence of modern religions have more emphasis on natural elements of nature, and that all elements of nature (including people and animals) share a common life force; Religions then focus gradually towards emphasizing humanity and its uniqueness as they age. As a means of asserting humanity’s difference and dominance over the natural world, spirits (godly life force) are canonized as unique to humans. The image of gods also shifts from being animalistic to humanoid.
There isn't much available online saying anything even remotely similar. From what I could tell, this was just the theory of a couple quack anthropologists from the 50’s. The book had probably been long overruled by more modern and rigorous research. 
The pages I was tasked with copying were on a religious belief of an unspecified native american tribe. In brief, their creation story involves a giant turtle which represents the earth. All of humanity, and the natural world resides on the back of its shell. This turtle laid two eggs, each meant to be the sun and the moon respectively. Each of these eggs eventually hatched. The egg representing the sun burst into a fireball of pure energy. And out of it, came the god figure 'Good Mind'. This god created all life on earth including the trees, animals, and humans. Good Mind also assists humanity in many ways throughout the years, explaining the existence of things like love, light, technology, etc... The being birthed from the moon egg on the other hand is referred to as 'Evil Mind'. This egg was apparently cracked by a malicious force. The creature born from it, was deformed and as you can probably guess, quite evil. Evil Mind shaped the earths' surface with mountains, cliffs, volcanos, crevices and corrupted once purely good humans with evil qualities as well as corrupting animals to create vicious predatory animals. The existence of Evil Mind is also used to explain many natural phenomena like disease, death, lightning, and so on.
Life is described as coming from spiritual forces which exist naturally. They are harnessed to give every new creature life, and are recycled back into nature once the creature expires. Now most interestingly, the pages the hacker told me to copy contain a pretty interesting story. In this story, the gods break their own rules. And purposefully so. This is quite rare in religion. But I suppose it makes sense, those who exist above physical rules are allowed to break them.
Good Mind and Evil Mind meet and argue over the nature of humanity. Evil Mind argues that when given the choice to abuse the natural laws that the gods created, they would do so. They would do so because of greed, lust, and hatred: the qualities Evil Mind had instilled in them. Good Mind argued that in such a scenario, people would only make use of such power for benevolence. And so, the two agreed to each create a worldy artifact with the power to break the cycles of life and death to give to the humans as a means of testing them.
Evil Mind came to earth, killed a caribou, ripped off its antler, and gave it to the humans as a weapon. He bestowed them with the power to destroy life, to release the spirit of any living creature. Something they had not been able to do before. So now, this explains how humans learned to hunt, and to murder.
Good Mind then came to earth, bit a fruit from a tree, then spit out its seed, giving it to the humans. Thus they learned to plant crops for food, and how to reproduce. Things they had not been able to do before. They learned how to harness life force to create new living things.

### The dissappearance of the Ohuyuga - Cedric Leopold

"He learned about their belief that every living thing has a spirit. That this spirit was the driving force of every living thing. One day, the village Shaman invited Gorik and a few others, among them the captain Chambly to participate in a feast to honor the enterrement of the village. The feast was nothing to write home about. But he burial is another story. Gorik recounts that after the animal was buried, the shaman did something. He said some words and waved his staff about. And out of the ground flew flourest blue orbs. They were supposely magnificient. And they burst out of the ground, intro the trees."

"The shaman explained that the sprit of any animal or human is contained in their bones. And when after they expire, and their bones are properly placed in the earth, their spirit escapes. He explained that all he had done was convinced the spirit to make themselves visibile, and to come out before the body was fully decomposed. The shaman continued his explanation, stating how these spirits would then go on to become the spirits of other new creatures that came into this world."

"Gorik being the inquisitive type asked the shaman the fatal question: could this process be reversed? At first the shaman was confused. Gorik continued asking if the life force (the spirit) from bones could be transferred to bodies to re-animate them and further if spirits could be convinced to enter a living thing to extend their life. The shaman was disgusted and horrified. He said something about this going against nature. Against the will of the   Great sprit. He asked the europeans to leave. And they did... for a time..."

"Relations with the tribe soured. And a sickness developed in Gorik's mind. He became obsessed with the possibility of using the spirits for his own selfish purposes. The tribe organization told him to stay away, so he conducted research in private, and spoke to those in the tribe sympathetic to him. He slowly corrupted the mind of captain Jaques Chambly. He tempted and wooed him with the promise of eternal life, and an army of undead soldiers. He convinced him to take reserach efforts to a violent and extreme level."

"They conducted a raid on the Ohuyuga village. They burned down every building, killed  many, and captured even more. They build the Fort Champlain on the old site of their village to better house the prisoners. In the following years, the other Iroquois nations having heard about the genocide, repeatedly attacked Fort Chambly in an effort to release the prisoners. The prisoners they tortured. Trying to extract the secret of the ritual from them. It is recoreded that Godrik Van Martens himself was heavily involved in the torture. That he used his knowledge of medecine to perfect the art of torture. But none of them spoke."

"When the last of the natives eventually died from their torture, the remaining europeans vowed to continue the search for the secret of the Ritual. To find the secret to immortality. But then to keep it for themselves and their children. But that was almost 400 years ago. And still we haven't succeeded in performing the ritual."

"We call ourselves the 7th tribe. But that name is ironic. Because we aren't the 7th Iroquois tribe, we're the ones who exterminated them. The only Ohuyuga blood we have in our veins is from the Ohuyuga women we raped. I have been indoctrinated into this cult since the day I was born. But this is too much. I can't let them actually go through with this.  I was supposed to be their new leader. But I had to leave. My brother Anthony is next in line. And he is a sick demented person. I  can't let him and all the others become this the world's new immortal tyrants. And just think about  all the bodies... all the bones... the soulds... that will prop them up. They've found something. An artifact that is suppost to complete the ritual." He said that last word with blood-curdelling enphasis. He paused for a moment then said "We're here". I looked outside and realized we were in Chambly."
